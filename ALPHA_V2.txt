    FUNCTIONALITY
        FridgeScreen and ShoppingListScreen: 
            - searching through list should be able to:
                - click on three dots and go to modal when keyboard was up
                - swipe on items
        AddFridgeItemScreen and AddShoppingListItemScreen:
            - persistent / not persistent states between add screen to actual screen
            - go to add item page should already have keyboard up and ready to search
